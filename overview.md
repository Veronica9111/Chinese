Overview

Pronunciation
-----------------

Compared to other popular languages, Chinese has four different tones(or should say there are five here)

* First tone（阴平）：ā
* Second tone（阳平）： á
* Third tone（上声）：ǎ
* Fourth tone（去声）：à
* The one without any tone（轻声）：a

Another difference is, one Chinese character only has one syllable, no matter how difficult it looks like. But usually we have to combine the characters together to make up some words which have meanings.

Writing
---------
All Chinese characters are made up by these basic strokes
* rightward stroke（横）：一
* downward stroke（竖）：丨
* dot（点）：丶
* rise（提）：㇀
* left-falling（撇）：丿
* right-falling（捺）：㇏
* turning（折）：乙、乚、┐
* hook（勾）：乛、亅

Radical
---------

Chinese has the concept of radical, the radical itself sometimes is a character as well, or changed from a character. The radical could be used to make up more complicated characters.

For example, the character 王 means 'king' in Chinese, it is also a radical, we could see it in 琰，环，珏..., it is changed a bit but we could still recognize it.

If you totally have no idea of one character's pronunciation, though the dictionary itself is in alphabetical order, you have to rely on radical to search the character inside the dictionary.
